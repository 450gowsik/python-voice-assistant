# Jarvis – Python Voice Assistant

Jarvis is a Python-based voice assistant that listens to user voice commands and responds interactively. It can greet the user based on the time of day, answer basic questions, tell the current time, search Wikipedia, and open popular websites like Google, YouTube, and Instagram.

## Features
- Voice-based interaction using microphone
- Time-based greeting (Good morning / evening)
- Tells current time
- Searches information from Wikipedia
- Opens websites using voice commands
- Exit using voice commands like "Stop" or "Bye"

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Speech Recognition
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Wikipedia API
- Web browser automation

## How It Works
The assistant continuously listens for voice input, converts speech to text, processes the command, and responds using text-to-speech. It runs interactively in the background until the user exits.

## Purpose
This project was built to practice Python automation, speech recognition, and real-time user interaction, similar to basic virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.
